# Holographic-3D
Its a virtual asistant maked with Unity, OpenAI API.

This code is a C# script for Unity that allows you to record audio using an avatary and then send it to a server for processing. Here is an explanation of the main functions and components of the code:

Class declaration:

The AudioRecorder class is declared and the IPointerDownHandler and IPointerUpHandler interfaces are added to it to handle button down events.
Public variables:

recordButton is a button that is assigned from the Unity editor and is used to start and stop recording audio.
audioSource is the Unity AudioSource component that will be used to play back the response from the server.
Private variables:

audioClip is an AudioClip object that stores the audio recording.
isRecording is a boolean flag indicating whether recording is currently being done.
Start method:

The Start method is executed when the script starts and is used to add an EventTrigger component to the record button. This makes it possible to detect pulse events.

Click event methods:

The OnPointerDown and OnPointerUp methods fire when the record button is pressed and released, respectively.
OnPointerDown starts recording audio using Unity's Microphone.Start function.
OnPointerUp stops recording audio using the Microphone.End function and then saves the recording to a PCM file using the SaveAudioClip method.
After saving the audio, StartCoroutine(Upload) is called to send the file to the server for processing.
SaveAudioClip method:

The SaveAudioClip method converts the audio data in the audioClip object to a byte array and saves it to a PCM file using the File.WriteAllBytes function.
Upload coroutine:

The Upload coroutine is used to send the audio file to the server via an HTTP POST request.
Reads bytes from the PCM file using File.ReadAllBytes and adds them to a form (WWWForm) along with additional information such as file name and content type.
Creates a UnityWebRequest and sends it to the server. It then waits for the response using yield return www.SendWebRequest().
If the response is successful, the URL of the processed audio is obtained and the DownloadAudio coroutine is started to download and play the audio.
DownloadAudio coroutine:

The DownloadAudio coroutine is used to download and play the rendered audio from the provided URL.
Creates a UnityWebRequest using UnityWebRequestMultimedia.GetAudioClip and sends it to the server.
Wait for the response using yield return www.SendWebRequest().
If the response is successful, it gets the AudioClip using DownloadHandlerAudioClip.GetContent and assigns it to the audioSource component to play it.
In short, this code allows to record audio in Unity
